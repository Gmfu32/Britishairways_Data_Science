I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, I’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number I’ve tried—online, via the airport, and through customer service—is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.</td>\n",

       "2     ✅ Trip Verified |   I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, I’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number I’ve tried—online, via the airport, and through customer service—is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.    29 April 2025    South Africa  10/10 rating  ✅ Trip Verified  I had an appalling experience with British Airways.

Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.\n",

Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant.

       "      <td>✅ Trip Verified |   I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, I’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number I’ve tried—online, via the airport, and through customer service—is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating.

At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant. Heathrow T5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section (A) can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details.</td>\n",

       "2     ✅ Trip Verified |   I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, I’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number I’ve tried—online, via the airport, and through customer service—is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.    29 April 2025    South Africa  10/10 rating  ✅ Trip Verified  I had an appalling experience with British Airways.

Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.\n",

Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant.

I had tried to reserve a vegetarian meal online the day before the flight but couldn't, and asked Sarah, the head flight attendant, if they might be able to provide one. She not only found a delicious meal from Premium, Economy, but was especially caring and helpful throughout the flight. The flight attendants also offered water and juice several times during the flight. I was also impressed with the wide range of entertainment offerings, which included some first-rate films.</td>\n",

       "      <td>✅ Trip Verified |   I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, I’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number I’ve tried—online, via the airport, and through customer service—is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.</td>\n",

So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant. Heathrow T5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section (A) can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details.</td>\n",

I had tried to reserve a vegetarian meal online the day before the flight but couldn't, and asked Sarah, the head flight attendant, if they might be able to provide one. She not only found a delicious meal from Premium, Economy, but was especially caring and helpful throughout the flight. The flight attendants also offered water and juice several times during the flight. I was also impressed with the wide range of entertainment offerings, which included some first-rate films.      15 May 2025   United States   5/10 rating  ✅ Trip Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                although transferring to this flight through heathrow from budapest took almost an hour the flight crew was welcoming and friendly as we boarded at the last minute i had tried to reserve a vegetarian meal online the day before the flight but couldnt and asked sarah the head flight attendant if they might be able to provide one she not only found a delicious meal from premium economy but was especially caring and helpful throughout the flight the flight attendants also offered water and juice several times during the flight i was also impressed with the wide range of entertainment offerings which included some firstrate films\n",

       "2     ✅ Trip Verified |   I had an appalling experience with British Airways. It started when I tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors. I arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out, but the staff at the check-in counter refused to help me—brushing me off before I could even say which flight I was on, simply saying all flights were full. Incredibly rude and unprofessional. The BA lounge was overcrowded, uncomfortable, and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating. Shortly before boarding, I was struck with excruciating abdominal pain. Fearing a medical emergency, I asked to be offloaded. Staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag, asked me to wait, and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes. I eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine. However, in my distress, I didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it. I asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help. None assisted me. I collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital. Thankfully, I received treatment and have now returned home. Since then, I’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage. Every number I’ve tried—online, via the airport, and through customer service—is either unreachable, goes to voicemail, or simply rings out. I have no idea where my bag is, and no one is helping. This is completely unacceptable from an international airline. British Airways has failed at every stage: technical support, in-person service, medical handling, and post-flight care.    29 April 2025    South Africa  10/10 rating  ✅ Trip Verified  i had an appalling experience with british airways it started when i tried to check in online but couldn’t change my seat due to repeated website errors i arrived at the airport 4 hours early to sort it out but the staff at the checkin counter refused to help me—brushing me off before i could even say which flight i was on simply saying all flights were full incredibly rude and unprofessional the ba lounge was overcrowded uncomfortable and poorly equipped—wooden utensils only and very limited seating shortly before boarding i was struck with excruciating abdominal pain fearing a medical emergency i asked to be offloaded staff at the boarding gate took my boarding pass and luggage tag asked me to wait and then left me sitting there in agony for 40 minutes i eventually asked to leave to go to hospital—staff said it was fine however in my distress i didn’t realise that they had taken my boarding pass with the baggage reference on it i asked a group of wheelchair porters heading in my direction for help none assisted me i collapsed midway and was finally stretchered away by medics and taken to hospital thankfully i received treatment and have now returned home since then i’ve been trying to retrieve my luggage every number i’ve tried—online via the airport and through customer service—is either unreachable goes to voicemail or simply rings out i have no idea where my bag is and no one is helping this is completely unacceptable from an international airline british airways has failed at every stage technical support inperson service medical handling and postflight care\n",

BA's T3 lounge is just not anything special, mediocre at best, food options lacking, its Gatwick & T5 lounges are far more superior. On board usual poor seat pitch, the Club Europe product is inconsistent, no hot towels, menu given however food delivered on a trolley in the economy way, all the courses on one tray. No further bar offerings unless one used the call bell. Parked on remote stand at Krakow. On return Krakow - LHR Queued for twenty minutes at the Club Europe check in desk, the non-BA lounge was basic and at the late departure time of the flight, minimal food choices. On boarding Cramped into a bus and walked up on remote stand. No menus or hot towels, however meal orders taken individually and delivered direct from the Galley, seat uncomfortable, no wi-fi. Had to request tea after meal. Again inconsistency in service. The extra cost of Club Europe is hard to justify, there have been improvements in catering, however the product needs to be elevated to justify the cost.    22 April 2025  United Kingdom   3/10 rating   ❌ Not Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               good points the cabin crew they were helpful professional and mature quantity and quality of food cleanliness of the aircraft which was spotless picture of a pub in the forward toilet and the flight was on time bas t3 lounge is just not anything special mediocre at best food options lacking its gatwick  t5 lounges are far more superior on board usual poor seat pitch the club europe product is inconsistent no hot towels menu given however food delivered on a trolley in the economy way all the courses on one tray no further bar offerings unless one used the call bell parked on remote stand at krakow on return krakow  lhr queued for twenty minutes at the club europe check in desk the nonba lounge was basic and at the late departure time of the flight minimal food choices on boarding cramped into a bus and walked up on remote stand no menus or hot towels however meal orders taken individually and delivered direct from the galley seat uncomfortable no wifi had to request tea after meal again inconsistency in service the extra cost of club europe is hard to justify there have been improvements in catering however the product needs to be elevated to justify the cost\n",

BA serve biscuits and a small bottle of water for free. This was ok for me but sandwiches had run out from the in-flight cafe to the disappointment of passengers. Inflight wifi is limited and you have to pay to access music or programmes. BA's offering is well below that of Aegean and this level of service is not suitable for easterly destinations such as Larnaca. So I would certainly fly again with BA to Athens but only in the event Aegean has no seats or the fare is cheaper.    22 April 2025  United Kingdom   6/10 rating   ❌ Not Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              it was a decent flight reasonable comfortable seat and pilot kept us nicely informed about the flights progress ba serve biscuits and a small bottle of water for free this was ok for me but sandwiches had run out from the inflight cafe to the disappointment of passengers inflight wifi is limited and you have to pay to access music or programmes bas offering is well below that of aegean and this level of service is not suitable for easterly destinations such as larnaca so i would certainly fly again with ba to athens but only in the event aegean has no seats or the fare is cheaper\n",

An uneventful journey with BA but their Boeing 747 from Vancouver was a flashback to the 1990's. Dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable - you could also occasionally feel the person's knees pushing into the back of your own seat. The in-flight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly. Arrival and transfer in BA's Terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing. The connecting flight to Amsterdam was a modern Airbus A319 with bright and comfortable interior/seating. Unless BA revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with Virgin Air Canada or even Air Transat for the Vancouver-London route.  4 December 2014          Canada   8/10 rating   ❌ Not Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                yvrlhrams an uneventful journey with ba but their boeing 747 from vancouver was a flashback to the 1990s dated interior with cold colours old seats that recline practically into your face making the already cramped space even more uncomfortable  you could also occasionally feel the persons knees pushing into the back of your own seat the inflight entertainment was equally old with a blurry screen and limited choice of entertainment the cabin crew were courteous and friendly arrival and transfer in bas terminal 5 was very smooth and relaxing the connecting flight to amsterdam was a modern airbus a319 with bright and comfortable interiorseating unless ba revamp their ageing 747 fleet consider fly with virgin air canada or even air transat for the vancouverlondon route\n",

Two were on the A380 one on the B787 and the fourth on a refurbished B777. So they all had the new seat. I find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right. The seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close. At 1.83m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system. The 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them. On the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate. I'm sure it was never planned for economy seating. Food ok - my special meals came as ordered. Flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant. Heathrow T5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section (A) can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details.  4 December 2014    South Africa   5/10 rating   ❌ Not Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 have just completed four flights with british airways all in economy and all longhaul two were on the a380 one on the b787 and the fourth on a refurbished b777 so they all had the new seat i find it comfortable although never seem to get the headrest really right the seats are narrow and on busy flights your neighbours can be rather close at 183m the leg room and spacing was fine although some seats do have restrictions with the entertainment system the 380 and 787 are very quiet which makes the toilets sound nosier should you be near them on the upper deck of the 380 the overhead bin space in the back economy section is woefully inadequate im sure it was never planned for economy seating food ok  my special meals came as ordered flights on time or early and staff helpful and pleasant heathrow t5 can be a problem depending on when you travel and the main section a can get very busy as people wait to learn the gate details\n",

We made the reservation many months ago attempted several times to select seats and were told we could not do so in advance but needed to wait until we got to the airport. This was our first time flying with them and every other airline we have ever flown has allowed us to sit together. It is usually assumed that if we are married and making the reservation together at the same time using one credit card and paying a lot for the trip that we actually want to sit next to each other. When we tried to change our seats to be together all representatives said being separated was typical. Which is strange because then you have a plane full of families that have been physically separated for no apparent reason.
